# Earthquake - Astrology Correlation Study

This project explores the fascinating realm of machine learning with an ambitious goal: searching for potential correlations between planetary positions and major earthquakes throughout history. The driving motivation behind this project is a deep sense of empathy and the desire to make a meaningful impact in the face of tragedy, such as the devastating 2023 Turkey earthquake that claimed the lives of many, including our beloved Aliye Varoglu. It is in her memory that this study is dedicated.

<h2>The Quest for Earthquake Prediction</h2>

Earthquakes have the potential to cause immense suffering and loss of life. The idea of forecasting earthquakes based on astrology may seem unconventional, but it's born out of a genuine desire to prevent future tragedies. If we can harness the power of predictive analytics, we might just be able to save countless lives.

<h2>Results and Insights</h2>

Despite unwavering dedication and rigorous analysis, this study did not yield a significant correlation between planetary positions and seismic activities. The most notable correlation factor discovered was the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of earthquake occurrences. This finding underscores the geographical consistency of earthquake-prone regions over time, which is a well-documented geological phenomenon.

<h2>The Journey Continues</h2>

The pursuit of knowledge is a collective endeavor, and while this project may not have found the correlation it sought, it doesn't rule out the possibility that such a connection exists. The research is shared with the wider community, inviting other researchers to build upon the work conducted here. The Jupyter notebook `deprem.ipynb` contains the entire research process, and the accompanying CSV files detail the incremental data cleaning and preprocessing stages.

We also welcome input and collaboration from professional astrologers. With numerous planetary features to consider, there may be a specific combination or approach that holds the key to unlocking a significant correlation. This endeavor, though challenging, has the potential to make a real difference in earthquake prediction and, ultimately, save lives in the future.
